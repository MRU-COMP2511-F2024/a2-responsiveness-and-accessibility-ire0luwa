# Web Accessibility

Manual and Automated Analysis:<br>
- No way to identify active links
- alternative text were not appropraite enough<br>

Changes Made:
 - alternative texts are more descriptive, as i have been able to put a text that well describes the image if it was an error generating image.<br>

 - active links can be identified once clicked on with the use of the active style in CSS.
